# Command Palette: Your All-in-One Tool

The Command Palette in Edit4i is a powerful and versatile tool that lets you quickly access almost all the features of the editor, discover new functionalities, and speed up your workflow using just your keyboard. Think of it as a search bar for everything you can *do* in Edit4i.

**Accessing the Command Palette:**

*   Press `Alt + J`

**What can you do with the Command Palette?**

*   **Execute Commands:** Run any built-in editor command, from saving a file to changing the theme.
*   **Open Files:** Quickly find and open project files by typing their name (similar to the Fuzzy Finder, but integrated into the Command Palette).
*   **Git commands:** Run any git based command such as push, pull, branch etc
*   **Search Settings:** Access and modify editor settings.
*   **More Features to Come:** As Edit4i evolves, the Command Palette will become even more powerful, giving you access to AI-powered features and other advanced functionalities.

**How to use the Command Palette**

1.  **Invoke:** Press `Alt + J` to bring up the Command Palette.
2.  **Type:** Start typing what you want to do. The Command Palette will dynamically filter the list of available commands based on your input. The search is "fuzzy," so you don't need to type the exact command name.
3.  **Navigate:** Use the `J` (down) and `K` (up) keys to move through the list of results.
4.  **Execute:** Press `Enter` to execute the selected command. You can also click the desired item with your mouse.

**Tips for Using the Command Palette Efficiently**

*   **Learn Key Commands:** Memorize the names of the commands you use most often to speed up your workflow.
*   **Use Aliases:** If a command name is long, look for shorter aliases in the Command Palette description.
*   **Explore:** Experiment with the Command Palette to discover new features and commands you didn't know existed.

**Example Use Cases**

*   **Quickly change the editor theme:** Open the Command Palette, type "theme," and select a new theme from the list.
*   **Save all open files:** Open the Command Palette, type "save all," and press enter.
*   **Find a specific setting:** Open the Command Palette, type the setting name (e.g., "font size"), and jump directly to the relevant settings panel (functionality TBD).
*   **Execute a Git command:** As described in the Git Command Palette documentation, type `git commit`, 'git push' and so on

The Command Palette in Edit4i is more than just a list of commands; it's an efficient tool for accessing the full power of your editor and customizing it to fit your needs.

		'git/command-palette',
      ],
    },
  ],
};
```

**Important considerations:**

*   **Image Paths:** You will likely need to update the `![Recent Projects]` and `![Source Control]` image paths in the markdown files to reflect the correct location of these images within your Docusaurus project. Place them within the `/static/img/` folder, and update the links accordingly (e.g., `![Source Control](/img/source-control.png)`).
*   **TBD (To Be Determined):**  Sections marked "TBD" should be updated with the proper details once they are implemented.
*   **Customization:** This is a basic framework; expand on these pages with real information.
*   **Testing:**  After adding files verify the installation to see how the documentation is displaying.
*   **Keep your documentation up with the editor roadmap**
