# Understanding Git Status

The Git integration in Edit4i visually represents the status of your repository. Understanding these statuses is crucial for effective version control.

**Common Git Statuses:**

*   **Untracked:** Files that are new to the repository and not yet under version control.
*   **Modified:** Files that have been changed since the last commit.
*   **Staged:** Files that have been added to the staging area, ready to be committed.
*   **Committed:** Changes that have been saved to the repository.

The Git Pane displays these statuses clearly, allowing you to quickly identify which files need attention.
