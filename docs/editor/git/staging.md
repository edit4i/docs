# Staging and Unstaging Changes

Before committing your changes, you need to stage them. Staging tells Git which changes you want to include in the next commit.

**Staging:**

*   Select the files you want to stage in the "Unstaged Changes" section and press the "+" button.
*   This moves the files to the "Staged Changes" section.

**Unstaging:**

*   Select the files you want to unstage in the "Staged Changes" section and press the "-" button.
*   This moves the files back to the "Unstaged Changes" section.
